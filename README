BarTab Lite (alcohol free)
==========================

Like BarTab for Firefox 3.x, but with less features. This just keeps
your tabs from loading (via the now built-in hook in Firefox) and
styles the not yet loaded tabs in the manner familiar to BarTab users.

Restartless add-on: enable it and it will be on, disable it and it
will be off. Pretty simple, eh?

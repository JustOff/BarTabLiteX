BarTab Lite X (alcohol free fork)
================================

This is a fork of philikon's BarTab Lite.
Read original description below.

> Like BarTab for Firefox 3.x, but with less features. This just keeps
> your tabs from loading (via the now built-in hook in Firefox) and
> styles the not yet loaded tabs in the manner familiar to BarTab users.
> 
> Restartless add-on: enable it and it will be on, disable it and it
> will be off. Pretty simple, eh?
